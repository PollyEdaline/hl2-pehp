viewmodel_fov 60 // ONLY for use with a weapons correction fix. Unfortunately, this still has some issues with the Gravity Gun and RPG, but it's nice to play with the viewmodels extended just a bit more.
m_rawinput 1 // Sets mouse input to raw, which should provide more reliable mouse movement. Default: 0
m_filter 1 // Smooths out mouse movement over 2 frames. Default: 0
sk_auto_reload_time 90 // How long in seconds before the player's holstered weapon reloads automatically. Default: 3. A value like this makes combat more tense and adds a small layer of complexity in keeping track of your reloads. At the same time, the player's guns will reload quietly in the background during exploration, when they are more likely to forget about reloading. This minimizes instances of the player being caught off-guard with empty magazines, which is a frustrating feeling as opposed to feeling tactical.
