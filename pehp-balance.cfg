sk_auto_reload_time 90 // How long in seconds before the player's holstered weapon reloads automatically. Default: 3
// A value like this makes combat more tense and adds a small layer of complexity in keeping track of your reloads. At the same time,
// the player's guns will reload quietly in the background during exploration, when they are more likely to forget about reloading.
// This minimizes instances of the player being caught off-guard with empty magazines, which is a frustrating feeling as opposed to
// feeling tactical.

sk_npc_dmg_buckshot 2 // How much damage NPCs deal with shotguns (per pellet). Default: 3
// A gentle nerf to the Combine Shotgunner's obscene damage. Not only is the base damage simply too high compared to other Combine enemies,
// they also tend to fire far more quickly than the player can with the same weapon. From what I understand, there's also some kind of bug in
// the code regulating how quickly they fire: https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/nnnex9/combine_strong/gzw1gzz/

sk_antlionguard_dmg_charge 35 // How much damage an antlion guard's charge attack deals. Default: 20
sk_antlionguard_dmg_shove 15 // How much damage an antlion guard's shove attack deals. Default: 10
// Currently, antlion guards are very easy to deal with for experienced players, even on Hard. Their attacks are extremely easy to avoid,
// and it's trivial to pump shotgun shells into them over and over to kill them. Increasing their health is likely to just make the fight
// more tedious, so instead their damage has been given a bit of a boost, which should punish players for getting complacent while still 
// allowing them to feel powerful if they keep their guard up.

// Unfortunately, due to some Source engine tomfoolery I don't know how to properly work around, we need to continually execute this script to make sure it actually sticks. We don't need to set it very often, and it doesn't matter if the loop breaks later.
