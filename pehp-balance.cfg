sk_auto_reload_time 60 // How long in seconds before the player's holstered weapon reloads automatically. Default: 3
// A value like this makes combat more tense and adds a small layer of complexity in keeping track of your reloads. At the same time,
// the player's guns will reload quietly in the background during exploration, when they are more likely to forget about reloading.
// This minimizes instances of the player being caught off-guard with empty magazines, which is a frustrating feeling as opposed to
// feeling tactical.

sk_npc_dmg_buckshot 2 // How much damage NPCs deal with shotguns (per pellet). Default: 3
// A gentle nerf to the Combine Shotgunner's obscene damage. Not only is the base damage simply too high compared to other Combine enemies,
// they also tend to fire far more quickly than the player can with the same weapon. From what I understand, there's also some kind of bug in
// the code regulating how quickly they fire: https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/nnnex9/combine_strong/gzw1gzz/

sk_plr_dmg_crowbar 14 // How much damage the player's crowbar deals. Default: 10
// Honestly, the crowbar just feels like lacks a little bit of heft. It takes six(!) hits to deal with a metrocop, and while metrocops aren't
// so scary, later in the game most enemies are too dangerous to whack with the crowbar anyway. This is just a gentle nudge in effectiveness,
// since if it deals too much damage we risk discouraging the player from using the gravity gun. A value of 14 was chosen because this value
// also affects damage dealt to props, and a value of 15 makes many objects break in one hit where they would previously break in two.

sk_antlionguard_dmg_charge 35 // How much damage an antlion guard's charge attack deals. Default: 20
sk_antlionguard_dmg_shove 15 // How much damage an antlion guard's shove attack deals. Default: 10
// Currently, antlion guards are very easy to deal with for experienced players, even on Hard. Their attacks are extremely easy to avoid,
// and it's trivial to pump shotgun shells into them over and over to kill them. Increasing their health is likely to just make the fight
// more tedious, so instead their damage has been given a bit of a boost, which should punish players for getting complacent while still 
// allowing them to feel powerful if they keep their guard up.

// Unfortunately, due to some Source engine tomfoolery I don't know how to properly work around, we need to continually execute this script to make sure it actually sticks.
