// ║    VISUALS    ║
// ╚═══════════════╝
mat_picmip -1 // Texture quality. Currently doesn't go beyond -1 in HL2, but if Valve ever unlocks it, this can go up to -10. Default: -1
r_shadowmaxrendered 512 // Defines the maximum number of high quality shadows rendered at once. Default: 32
r_decals 4096 // Defines the maximum number of decals in the world before erasing the oldest one. Default: 2048
r_maxmodeldecal 100 // Defines the maximum number of decals on a model (as opposed to the world) before erasing the oldest one. Default: 50
cl_phys_props_max 600 // Maximum number of clientside physics props. Default: 300
default_fov 75; fov_desired 75 // Default field of view. Default: 75. As explained in the developer commentary, the decision to set the default FOV to 75 was a deliberate one made with the intention of highlighting the unique and impressive facial animation system at the time. Since the aim of this preset is to preserve HL2's art style, we force an override of 75 here for most users. If you'd like to override this, please make sure you do so in preferences.cfg, otherwise this config will override it when you start the game.
g_ragdoll_fadespeed 0 // The length of time in milliseconds it takes to fade out a corpse when it's removed. A value of 0 will prevent ragdolls from fading out. Because g_ragdoll_maxcount doesn't work currently, this can eventually build up too many corpses and cause the engine to crash. This shouldn't be a problem unless a dedicated player goes a little crazy on certain maps. Default: 600
g_ragdoll_lvfadespeed 0 // The length of time in milliseconds it takes to fade out a corpse when it's removed in the deprecated Low Violence mode. Default: 100
r_radiosity 2 // Controls the quality of radiosity. A value of 2 is "radiosity with 162 samples" for everything that can be affected. Default: 4
mat_tonemap_algorithm 1 // Sets the desired tonemap algorithm. We set it here in case you come back from another episode. Default: 1
mat_hdr_uncapexposure 0 // Toggles whether to cap the maximum exposure level for HDR. We set it here in case you come back from another episode. Default: 0

// ║    MOTION BLUR   ║
// ╚══════════════════╝
// These particular settings are directly from Xeogin's HL2DM config.
mat_motion_blur_enabled 1 // Toggles motion blur. Default: 1
mat_motion_blur_strength 0.5 // Overall motion blur strength. Default: 1.0
mat_motion_blur_falling_max 15 // Maximum blur from falling. Default: 20
mat_motion_blur_falling_min 5 // Minimum blur from falling. Default: 10
mat_motion_blur_percent_of_screen_max 1.5 // Maximum percentage of screen that can blur. Default: 4
mat_motion_blur_rotation_intensity .05 // Blur caused by rotational motion. Default 1.0
mat_motion_blur_forward_enabled 1 // Toggles motion blur when moving forward. This effect is most noticeable in vehicles. Default: 0

// ╔════════════════════╗
// ║    OPTIMIZATION    ║
// ╚════════════════════╝
bugreporter_uploadasync 1 // Upload bug reporter attachments asynchronously. Default: 0
engine_no_focus_sleep 0 // Limits engine responsiveness when out of focus. Higher values will give the engine less resources. 0 will always run the same regardless of focus. Default: 50
r_hunkalloclightmaps 0 // Seems to affect how memory is allocated for light data: https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/2445#issuecomment-181585777 A value of 0 allows higher amounts of memory be used. Probably not useful in vanilla HL2, but may occasionally be useful for custom maps. Default: 1
r_norefresh 1 // Toggles storing a useless and unused frame time variable. Default: 0
threadpool_affinity 0 // Toggles affinity, allowing the OS to schedule threads efficiently. Default: 1
r_threaded_renderables 1 // Asynchronously set up bones on animated entities. Default: 0
mod_load_anims_async 1 // Asynchronous animation loading. Default: 0
mod_load_mesh_async 1 // Asynchronous mesh loading. Default: 0

jpeg_quality 100 // I'm sure they had a good reason for this... Default: 90
cc_captiontrace 0 // Toggles reporting missing captions in the console. Does not function as of Nov 2024. Default: 1
con_filter_enable 1 // Handles how filtered console text will be displayed. 1 will filter it completely, while 2 highlights filtered text. Default: 0
con_filter_text "" // Defines text for the filter. When con_filter_enable is set to 1, this will filter OUT all other text EXCEPT for this. Default: ""
con_filter_text_out "No caption found" // Defines text to be filtered out of console spew completely. Here we use it to replace the non-functioning cc_captiontrace, but ideally we would use it to remove the useless death message reporting. Default: ""
phys_penetration_error_time 0 // Controls the duration of vphysics penetration error messages. The player should never need to see these even if there's a problem. Default: 10
dsp_enhance_stereo 1 // Enables additional Digital Sound Processor effects. Default: 0
snd_ducktovolume_commentary 0.35 // Volume to duck the rest of the game to while playing a commentary node. Extremely low by default. This is 35% volume. Default: 0.10
