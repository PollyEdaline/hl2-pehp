// Based on my many years of experience playing Source games, as well as:
// The TF2 mastercomfig: https://comfig.app/
// Xeogin's HL2DM Community Patch: https://github.com/Xeogin/HL2DM-Community-Patch-Config
// V92's list of console commands and descriptions: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2598659064
// This file must be placed inside of steamapps\common\Half-Life 2\hl2_complete\cfg
// Afterwards, make sure the file is correctly named autoexec.cfg.
// It should load automatically when you start the game.

// ╚════════════════╝
sk_auto_reload_time 90 // How long in seconds before the player's holstered weapon reloads automatically. Default: 3
// A value like this makes combat more tense and adds a small layer of complexity in keeping track of your reloads. At the same time, the player's guns will reload quietly in the background during exploration, when they are more likely to forget about reloading. This minimizes instances of the player being caught off-guard with empty magazines, which is a frustrating feeling as opposed to feeling tactical.

sk_npc_dmg_buckshot 2 // How much damage NPCs deal with shotguns (per pellet). Default: 3
// A gentle nerf to the Combine Shotgunner's obscene damage. Not only is the base damage simply too high compared to other Combine enemies, they also tend to fire far more quickly than the player can with the same weapon. From what I understand, there's also some kind of bug in the code regulating how quickly they fire: https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/nnnex9/combine_strong/gzw1gzz/

mat_envmapsize 4096 // Resolution of the environment map. Default: 128
mat_envmaptgasize 4096 // Resolution of sprayed textures. Default: 32
mat_picmip -1 // Texture quality. Currently doesn't go beyond -1 in HL2, but if Valve ever unlocks it, this can go up to -10. Default: -1
r_shadowmaxrendered 512 // Defines the maximum number of high quality shadows rendered at once. Default: 32
r_decals 4096 // Defines the maximum number of decals in the world before erasing the oldest one. Default: 2048
r_maxmodeldecal 100 // Defines the maximum number of decals on a model (as opposed to the world) before erasing the oldest one. Default: 50
cl_phys_props_max 600 // Maximum number of clientside physics props. Default: 300
default_fov 75 // Default field of view. Default: 75. As explained in the developer commentary, the decision to set the default FOV to 75 was a deliberate one made with the intention of highlighting the unique and impressive facial animation system at the time. Since the aim of this preset is to preserve HL2's art style, we force an override of 75 here for most users. If you'd like to override this, please make sure you do so in preferences.cfg, otherwise this config will override it when you start the game.
g_ragdoll_maxcount 256 // Amount of ragdolls that will exist in a map at once. Source will become unstable if there are too many ragdolls even on modern hardware, so this is clamped to a relatively sane value. There are almost no maps in Vanilla HL2 that can even generate this many ragdolls, so this should prevent instability on custom maps.  Default: 8
g_ragdoll_important_maxcount 50 // Amount of larger ragdolls that will exist in a map at once, such as Striders. Default: 2

mat_motion_blur_enabled 1 // Toggles motion blur. Default: 1
mat_motion_blur_strength 0.5 // Overall motion blur strength. Default: 1.0
mat_motion_blur_falling_max 15 // Maximum blur from falling. Default: 20
mat_motion_blur_falling_min 5 // Minimum blur from falling. Default: 10
mat_motion_blur_percent_of_screen_max 1.5 // Maximum percentage of screen that can blur. Default: 4
mat_motion_blur_rotation_intensity .05 // Blur caused by rotational motion. Default 1.0
mat_motion_blur_forward_enabled 1 // Toggles motion blur when moving forward. This effect is most noticeable in vehicles. Default: 0

bugreporter_uploadasync 1 // Upload bug reporter attachments asynchronously. Default: 0
engine_no_focus_sleep 0 // Limits engine responsiveness when out of focus. Higher values will give the engine less resources. 0 will always run the same regardless of focus. Default: 50
r_hunkalloclightmaps 0 // Seems to affect how memory is allocated for light data: https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/2445#issuecomment-181585777 A value of 0 allows higher amounts of memory be used. Probably not useful in vanilla HL2, but may occasionally be useful for custom maps. Default: 1
r_norefresh 1 // Toggles storing a useless and unused frame time variable. Default: 0
threadpool_affinity 0 // Toggles affinity, allowing the OS to schedule threads efficiently. Default: 1

con_filter_text_out "No caption found" // Defines text to be filtered out completely. Here we use it to replace the non-functioning cc_captiontrace. Default: ""
phys_penetration_error_time 0 // Controls the duration of vphysics penetration error messages. The player should never need to see these even if there's a problem. Default: 10
dsp_enhance_stereo 1 // Enables additional Digital Sound Processor effects. Default: 0
snd_ducktovolume_commentary 0.35 // Volume to duck the rest of the game to while playing a commentary node. Extremely low by default. This is 35% volume. Default: 0.10
