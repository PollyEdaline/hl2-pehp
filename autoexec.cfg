// Based on my many years of experience playing Source games, as well as:
// The TF2 mastercomfig: https://comfig.app/
// Xeogin's HL2DM Community Patch: https://github.com/Xeogin/HL2DM-Community-Patch-Config
// V92's list of console commands and descriptions: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2598659064
// This file must be placed inside of steamapps\common\Half-Life 2\hl2_complete\cfg
// Afterwards, make sure the file is correctly named autoexec.cfg.
// It should load automatically when you start the game.

// ║    RAGDOLLS    ║
// ╚════════════════╝
cl_ragdoll_collide 1 // Toggle whether generated ragdolls collide with each other. Seems to have been broken since Orange Box according to the developer wiki, and currently doesn't function as of November 2024. Default: 0
g_ragdoll_fadespeed 0 // Length of time before ragdolls fade out. 0 disables fading out. Default: 600
g_ragdoll_lvfadespeed_0 // Length of time before ragdolls fade out in Low Violence Mode. 0 disables fading out. Doesn't really do anything anymore since no new copies of the game are sold with this mode enabled, but it can't hurt. Default: 100
g_ragdoll_maxcount 256 // Amount of ragdolls that will exist in a map at once. Source will become unstable if there are too many ragdolls even on modern hardware, so this is clamped to a relatively sane value. There are almost no maps in Vanilla HL2 that can even generate this many ragdolls, so this should prevent instability on custom maps. Default: 8
g_ragdoll_important_maxcount 50 // Amount of larger ragdolls that will exist in a map at once, such as Striders. Default: 2

// ║    VISUALS    ║
// ╚═══════════════╝

// ═══•°• TEXTURES •°•═══
mat_envmapsize 4096 // Resolution of the environment map. Default: 128
mat_envmaptgasize 4096 // Resolution of sprayed textures. Default: 32
mat_picmip -1 // Texture quality. Currently doesn't go beyond -1 in HL2, but if Valve ever unlocks it, this can go up to -10. Default: -1

// ═══•°• MOTION BLUR •°•═══
// These particular settings are directly from Xeogin's HL2DM config.
mat_motion_blur_enabled 1 // Toggles motion blur. Default: 1
mat_motion_blur_strength 0.5 // Overall motion blur strength. Default: 1.0
mat_motion_blur_falling_max 15 // Maximum blur from falling. Default: 20
mat_motion_blur_falling_min 5 // Minimum blur from falling. Default: 10
mat_motion_blur_percent_of_screen_max 1.5 // Maximum percentage of screen that can blur. Default: 4
mat_motion_blur_rotation_intensity .05 // Blur caused by rotational motion. Default 1.0
mat_motion_blur_forward_enabled 1 // Toggles motion blur when moving forward. This effect is most noticeable in TF2's kill cam. Default: 0

// ═══•°• DECALS •°•═══
r_decals 4096 // Defines the maximum number of decals in the world before erasing the oldest one. Default: 2048
r_maxmodeldecal 100 // Defines the maximum number of decals on a model (as opposed to the world) before erasing the oldest one. Default: 100

// ═══•°• DRAW DISTANCE •°•═══
cl_maxrenderable_dist 8096 // Max distance from the camera at which things will be rendered. It seems like the engine will forcibly set this back to default sometimes. Default: 3000
cl_detaildist 16384 // Controls the render distance of detail props. It seems like the engine will forcibly set this back to default sometimes. Default: 4096
lod_TransitionDist 6400 // Distance at which models transition to LOD. Default: 800
cl_detailfade 4096 // Sets the point at which detail objects begin to fade out before disappearing entirely. Default: 400
r_lod 0 // Controls FOV level. 0 disables all FOV, which should not be a problem on modern systems. Set to -1 to compute LOD normally. Default: 0
r_shadowdist 500 // Defines the length away at which shadows are visible. It seems like the engine will forcibly set this back to default sometimes. Default: 75
r_shadowmaxrendered 512 // Defines the maximum number of high quality shadows rendered at once. Default: 32

// ═══•°• MISC •°•═══
cl_ejectbrass 1 // Toggles casing/shell ejection from various weapons. Very minor performance impact. Default: 1
cl_phys_props_max 600 // Maximum number of clientside physics props. Default: 300
default_fov 75 // Default field of view. Default: 75. As explained in the developer commentary, the decision to set the default FOV to 75 was a deliberate one made with the intention of highlighting the unique and impressive facial animation system at the time. Since the aim of this preset is to preserve HL2's art style, we force an override of 75 here for most users. If you'd like to override this, please make sure you do so in preferences.cfg, otherwise this config will override it when you start the game.

// ╔════════════════════╗
// ║    OPTIMIZATION    ║
// ╚════════════════════╝
bugreporter_uploadasync 1 // Upload bug reporter attachments asynchronously. Default: 0
engine_no_focus_sleep 0 // Limits engine responsiveness when out of focus. Higher values will give the engine less resources. 0 will always run the same regardless of focus. Default: 50
r_hunkalloclightmaps 0 // Seems to affect how memory is allocated for light data: https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues/issues/2445#issuecomment-181585777 A value of 0 unclamps this value and lets higher amounts of memory be used. Probably not useful in vanilla HL2, but may occasionally be useful for custom maps. Default: 1
r_norefresh 1 // Toggles store a useless and unused frame time variable. Default: 0
threadpool_affinity 0 // Toggles affinity, allow the OS to schedule threads efficiently. Default: 1
r_threaded_renderables 1 // Asynchronously set up bones on animated entities. Default: 0
mod_load_anims_async 1 // Asynchronous animation loading. Default: 0
mod_load_mesh_async 1 // Asynchronous mesh loading. Default: 0

jpeg_quality 100 // I'm sure they had a good reason for this... Default: 90
cc_captiontrace 0 // Toggles reporting missing captions in the console. Does not function as of Nov 2024. Default: 1
con_filter_enable 1 // Handles how filtered console text will be displayed. 1 hides filtered text, 2 highlights filtered text. Default: 0
con_filter_text "" // Defines text to be filtered. Default: ""
con_filter_text_out "No caption found" // Defines text to be filtered out completely. Here we use it to replace the non-functioning cc_captiontrace. Default: ""
phys_penetration_error_time 0 // Controls the duration of vphysics penetration error messages. The player should never need to see these even if there's a problem. Default: 10
dsp_enhance_stereo 1 // Enables additional Digital Sound Processor effects. Default: 0

// HUD and Weapon toggle. See preferences.cfg for more options.
