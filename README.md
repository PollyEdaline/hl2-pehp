Polly's Enhanced HL2 Preset
=========
A configuration file for Half-Life 2 that enhances the game while retaining the original style. Eventually, a full guide on Steam will also include various other tweaks, including suggested mods, all with retaining the goal of lightly enhancing the original experience. There are no major overhauls and no over the top shaders, just a minimal layer of extra polish on top of the wonderful 20th Anniversary Update.

INSTALLATION
------------
For now, you'll just have to download the file from Github manually. Make sure the file is placed in `steamapps\common\Half-Life 2\hl2_complete\cfg`

TWEAKING
------
You can manually set up a `preferences.cfg` file in the same directory as the main `autoexec.cfg` file. Any commands in this file will override the ones in `autoexec.cfg`. For example, you can use this to set your `default_fov` to `90`.

UPDATING
------
Just override `autoexec.cfg` while retaining your `preferences.cfg`.

MISC
------
Right now, the config also includes a keybind called `togglehud`, which will toggle both the HUD as well as your weapon viewmodel for taking clean screenshots. This is bound to `.` by default. You can also type `enhance` in the console to run the preset again, assuming it loaded correctly the first time.

CONTACT
-------
If you would like to report bugs, make suggestions, or have any other feedback, please feel free to open an issue on GitHub for the time being.
